Build Instructions for installation of Browser-PoC on Ubuntu 12.04
==================================================================

If your target is to build GENIVI's Browser Proof-of-Concept on Ubuntu
12.04 LTS, then these instructions may help you through the build
process. The build process is slightly different if you're using
Ubuntu's version of Qt 5.

System requirements
-------------------

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

To get a later version of Qt on Ubuntu 12.04, which was released
nearly two years ago, you can use the Ubuntu provided SDK for Qt
available as a PPA.[1] The easiest way to do this is to add to 
/etc/apt/sources.list these two lines;

 deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa/ubuntu precise main 
 deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa/ubuntu precise main 

Alternatively Ubuntu puts PPAs in the sources.list.d directory so you
can put those two lines in a file called
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu-sdk-team-ppa-precise.list
and then run;

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev

The above commands install the headers / libraries necessary for
development with Qt and QML.
