| **NOT ACTIVE*** | This project is considered **done** for this moment, so no more changes are expected.  It is kept here for the benefit of the community. | 

**References**: The main new browser development happens in the chromium components that can be found in [GDP](https://github.com/GENIVI/genivi-dev-platform)

\*_**NOT ACTIVE**_ _projects can become **PARTIAL** or **ACTIVE** again if _you_ step up to the maintenance role.  If you just have a single patch, you might contact a GENIVI mailing list or GENIVI staff and ask, but there is no guarantee that it will be reviewed or merged.  It is +your+ responsibility to take over maintenance if you want to introuce changes.  If instead you choose to fork the project to another location, that is of course allowed but we would appreciate a courtesy note and link to the other repo._
