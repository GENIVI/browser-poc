Build instructions
==================

System requirements
-------------------

Development platform is Linux.

To build all applications, it's required to use Qt 5.1 (or later).
See http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-lib for download.

For the browser application and the demoUI application Qt 5.0 would be sufficient.
The testapp application requires Qt 5.1, because of the use of Qt Quick Controls 
(http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtquickcontrols/qtquickcontrols-index.html).

If building Qt from source, all Qt Essential modules and the Qt Declarative module are necessary
(see http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/qtmodules.html).


Build
-----

To build all applications at once, run

  <path_to_qt_installation>/bin/qmake -r browser-poc.pro
  make

To build the separate applications on its own, run

  cd <browser|demoui|testapp>
  <path_to_qt_installation>/bin/qmake <browser|demoui|testapp>.pro
  make

Run
---

Always start the browser application first, then start the demoUI or test application. 

For more detailed information about usage and overview, see documentation on the Genivi wiki.
