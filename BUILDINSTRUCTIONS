Build instructions
==================

System requirements
-------------------

To build all applications, it's required to use Qt 5.1 (or later).
See http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-lib for download.

For the browser application and the demoUI application Qt 5.0 would be sufficient.
The testapp application requires Qt 5.1, because the use of Qt Quick Controls.

For building Qt from source, all Qt Essential modules and the Qt Declarative module are necessary
(see http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/qtmodules.html).
